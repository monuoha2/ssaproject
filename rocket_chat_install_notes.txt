When you get to the step where you actually unpack the rocket-chat tar file you need to be a user that is NOT root. Preferrably switch to the user "vagrant" if you are using vagrant. Also for the next step where you actually run "npm install" and run the build process, you need to be a user that is NOT root. So what this means is that if you are using Ansible to an auto install you need to use "become" during those 2 steps which I just mentione.
